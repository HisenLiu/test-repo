Appendix of lessons learned

During the period working on Case Study 2, there were two things that impressed me. Both of them wasted me a lot of time to figure out what on earth the problem was. The first one was about cleaning up and combining the categories. I had to work on these chaotic categories slowly to decide which group they should go to. And for some items I needed to modify them one by one. But no matter how many times I tried to run the code, it didn't work. Not until I had spent a long time did I finally realize that I forgot to put the next line "tt = sort(table(skill2), decreasing = TRUE )" behind the new code I wrote to make sure it function well. Now I always remember to add the tail of a relatively complete part when coding. The second one was that Machine Learning could not be fit on page although I had already rescaled the wordcloud. So I just abbreviated it to M.Learning. Maybe there is a specific method to make it fit on page but I just cannot find it after hours and hours searching. However, it is indeed an effective way to make it work. Data science is just the same thing. Sometimes we could use the simplest way to solve the problem that seems to be difficult, although it might look stupid when it comes to your mind at first.
